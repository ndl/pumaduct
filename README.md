Intro
=====

PuMaDuct is a transport for [Matrix IM servers](https://matrix.org) that integrates [libpurple](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple)-supported IM protocols into Matrix.

**NOTE**: as of 2020-09-27 PuMaDuct needs to be upgraded to the latest version of the Matrix protocol spec. I expect to carry the upgrade process over the course of 2020-10.
